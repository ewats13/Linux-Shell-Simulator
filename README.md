# Linux-Shell-Simulator
This C progam was written for a ECE437 (Operating Systems) assignment at UNM.

The program is designed to simulate a Linux shell, and has the following features:

- Handles background jobs, designated with an ampersand "&" at the end of the command.
- Signal handler, to deal with the singal SIGINT which is generated by typing "ctrl-c" from the keyboard. However, instead of terminating the shell, it will print out a record of the last ten commands entered.
- Allows the standard input or output file to be redirected using the "<" and ">" symbols.
- Supports piping. The standard output from one program may be redirected into the standard input of another program using the "|" symbol.

**Additional Features**
- Custom command prompt "mini437sh-EW"
- Entering "last10" as a command will return a record of the last ten commands, as does "ctrl-c".
- If a user types "exit", the shell will check and terminate any unfinished background jobs, then terminate itself.
- Should the program encounter any errors in executing commands, the shell program will not terminate.
